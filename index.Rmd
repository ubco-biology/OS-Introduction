# (PART\*) OS 101 {-}

# Welcome {-}

This text was built to accompany the first year of the Biology undergraduate degree program at UBC Okanagan. It's aim is to introduce learners to core considerations in the pursuit of open scientific practices. It's divided into three sections, the first exploring principles and concepts associated with Open Science, the second and third looking at these principles and concepts in practice.

Part 1, *Principles of Open Science* will be covered in BIOL 116. Parts 2 and 3, *Open Science in Action: Benefits* and *Open Science in Action: Challenges*, will be covered in BIOL 125.

Parts 2 and 3 are pending release.
